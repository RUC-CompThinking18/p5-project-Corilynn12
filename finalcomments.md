# Interactivity
I really liked being able to create more flowers in order to reveal the message. Sometimes they didn't appear exactly where I expected, but it generally worked well.

# Code Quality
You clearly did some research in trying to accomplish what you were doing since you used the class constructor (which I have Thoughts about I'm sure you don't care to know) and "this", which is a concept that can be really, really tricky in JS.

# Aesthetics
Finally, a project that makes use of *all* your skills. Great work.
